# Grubhub MTG League Rules

## Packs
* Start with 3 packs
* After 3 matches, add another pack to your deck
* Every 3 (cumulative) losses, add another pack to your deck
* Initial buy in ($9) should be paid via Venmo (Andrew-Baber), Paypal (agbaber@gmail.com) or LevelUp (DM me on Slack @andrewb)
* You can join whenever you want
* You can use your own packs, but cannot add more than the normal number or use cards from outside your packs
* No trading cards until after the league is over

## Decks
* 30 card decks minimum, no maximum
* Usually 13 lands, 17 non-lands (adjusted based on your deck “speed”)
* Usually 2 colors with a 3rd splashed, or 4-5 colors if your base color is green and you have plenty of “fixing”

## Matches
* 3 matches per week
* Best of 1 or Best of 3, decide before playing
* Best of 1 recommended for newer players
* Try not to play the same person more than once per week, if possible
* Matches should be played at lunch or after work

## Games
* One free mulligan (7 new cards) then for each mulligan after that, you choose that number of cards and put them on the bottom of your deck before starting the game
* Roll dice to decide who goes first
* If you go first, you don’t draw on your first turn
* If you have a question or need a ruling, ask in Slack or if other players are around, ask them. If it’s REALLY specific or complicated, ask in judge chat https://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/
